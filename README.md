## ATM Transactions analytics and Insights 

**Overview:**

This portfolio project focuses on analyzing ATM transactions for a fictitious bank called **Wasabi Bank**. Wasabi Bank is a prominent bank located in Nigeria, with its headquarters in Lagos and branches in _Kano_, _Rivers State_, _Enugu_, and _FCT Abuja_. Using Power BI, I leveraged Business Intelligence techniques and Power BI to analyze ATM transaction data for the bank.

The objective is to provide valuable insights to address important business questions and aid in data-driven decision-making. By delving into the data, I uncovered key findings that can enable the bank to understand customer behavior, optimize operational efficiency, and enhance customer satisfaction.

- Through meticulous analysis, I identified crucial insights that included transaction patterns, peak transaction times, transaction types, customer demographics, and utilization rates across various locations. By visualizing these insights using interactive dashboards, Wasabi Bank gained a holistic view of its ATM operations and customer behavior.
- The power of Business Intelligence became evident as I showcased the average transaction amounts by location and transaction type, allowing the bank to identify areas of high transaction volume and potential revenue growth. Moreover, by analyzing customer demographics and transaction frequencies, I provided Wasabi Bank with insights into the preferences of different age groups and the most common transaction types among its customers.
- Another significant aspect of the project was identifying transaction trends over time. By visualizing transaction volumes and amounts, I unveiled seasonal patterns and helped the bank anticipate fluctuations in demand, plan resource allocation, and make informed decisions regarding staffing and ATM maintenance.
- Additionally, the project addressed the utilization rates of ATM locations, pinpointing the ones with the highest and lowest activity. This information enabled the bank to optimize its services, enhance customer experiences, and improve overall operational efficiency.

Overall, through the implementation of Business Intelligence techniques and the use of Power BI, this portfolio project successfully delivered critical insights to Wasabi Bank. By gaining a deep understanding of customer behavior, transaction patterns, and utilization rates, the bank was equipped to make data-driven decisions, enhance its services, and maintain a competitive edge in the financial market.

**Data Availability:**

The analyzed data covers the period from 2021 to 2022, providing a comprehensive understanding of ATM transactions within this timeframe.

By addressing these problem statements and providing data-driven insights, this portfolio project showcases my proficiency in data analysis, visualization, and problem-solving using Power BI.
